# DUAL by wochonecha

Hey there! Welcome to the github repo of our project for the first internal hackathon held by Dfinity Foundation.

We imagined DUAL as a social platform to get out of our comfort zone and complete challenges. The challenges could be picked up from the challenge library, or you can create your own! You can set the progress on challenge you accept and eventually mark them complete. What's best is that you can receive challenges from friends, or challenge them! Let's get better, together, today!

Here are [smartphone mocks of DUAL](https://www.figma.com/proto/I5JeDiFOH08tH2N1a169zr/Dual?node-id=296%3A7484&viewport=718%2C1606%2C0.3781742751598358&scaling=scale-down), and [here is a more detailed description of DUAL by Wochonecha](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1820D5VJJMyk7WfsRyxFH91K4uuMSyvpN8ropqEAKWbM).  Enjoy!
